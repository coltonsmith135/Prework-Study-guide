# Prework Study Guide To Success

## Description

This project is a study guide for the coding bootcamp to be able to look back on and study to solidify my knoledge with HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
I built this project in order to remind me the proper way to write code and to be able to double check my work if I were to get stuck while writing code.
When learning how to code for the first time it can be extreamly difficult to retain all the information so this study guide will help with absorbing more information as you learn how to code.
I learned how to build a strong foundation while also styling my website and making it interactive using JavaScript and then the process of uploading it to the GitHub website.

It also allows you to open the DevTools console to make sure that JavaScript is running. It will list the topics that were learned during the Prework and you are able to choose one topic to study first.
